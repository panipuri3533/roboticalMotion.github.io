                This robot was my first robotic mindstorm creation. I got this picture from when I posted and edited it from the Lego Life app. As you can see, I got the lego mindstorm kit to make this.
                This contains a turret mounted on top of the robot(Some pieces were from normal lego sets too). This took me straight up 1 week to make and it ws worth it.<br>

                This is the second version of my first creation. this version is fully automated from where it turns on untill when the turret on the top turn on. I changed how
                the touch sensor works and the way it is placed so that when the robot gets bumped into something, it turns on the turret!
                Even though this is a simple robot structure, keep in mind this was one of my starting creations so I had to get used to it! As you keep digging deep, the creations get complex
                and complex!<br>

                This robot was the start of my inovative journey to creating more interesting robots. In this picture, you can see that I tried to turn the wheel to tracks so it would
                allow me to use the wheels for something else (coming up) and it would look like I created a tank with a turret on top!! As you can see, I still kept the long stick connected to
                the touch sensor so that it still turns the turret on automaticly and I also incuded another touch sensor to manually start it.<br>

                This robot is almost the same as the one before but instead of 1 set of tracks, it uses 2 so that it is balanced on each side. Also, the code was changed so that the gyro
                sensor makes the robot help go in a straight line so that every thing is accurately meassured and acted upon. The robot is also programed to use the ultra sonic sensor so that
                it can determine when to stop if an object is blank amounto of units away from the robot.<br>
